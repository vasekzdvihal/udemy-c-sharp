# C# Basics

- Simple - fewer operators, no pointers, etc.
- Modern - Garbage collection, improved security
- Object oriented
    - Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
    - No global functions, variables or constants
    - Everything is encapsulated inside a class
- Type safe
    - Cannot use uninitialised variables
    - Unsafe casts are not allowed
- Versionable - C# supports the versioning functionality provided by Common Language Specifications (CLS)
- Compatible
    - Allow you to access different APIs
    - Compiler insures CLS Compliance
- Flexible
    - Classes and/or methods can be declared as unsafe
    - Establishing use of pointers and other items that are required to use other APIs

## Object Oriented Programming

- Program functionality is grouped into and carried out by objects
- The objects are defined by classes that are used to create the objects
  Advantages
- Code is divided into stand-alone groups
- Code can be easily re-used
- Complexity is reduced
- De-coupling can be achieved
- Extensibility

Three main characteristics of OOP

I. ENCAPSULATION

- Grouping of data and functions into a single component
- Allows selective 'hiding' of data and functionalities
- Provides security and ease of use for objects
- Example: Making a call using smartphone

II. INHERITANCE

- Enables one class to reuse code from another class
- A single object can passes the the functionality of multiple classes
- Avoids code duplications
- Provides the ability to extend and modify behaviour in an easily maintained environment

III. POLYMORPHISM

- The result of inheritance and encapsulation
- The ability to provide different functionalities for the same method name
- Based on the context of how the method is called
- An inheritance hierarchy of classes and objects can provide multiple functions bearing the same name, but different
  functionalities

## Classes

What does a class do?

- A class is a template that is used to create objects
- Provides necessary details for building software objects
- A class is the software version
- A class is similar to blueprint that is used to construct buildings
- A blueprint, can be used to construct multiple buildings
- A class can be used to create multiple objects

## Objects

A objects is a variable that contains two things:

- The properties that were defined in the class
- The abilities defined as methods in the class
- Multiple objects can be create based on a single class
- Each object has its own 'state' or unique collection of data values
- Making a change to a class will affect every object created from that class

## C# Types

- C# is a strongly-typed language
  - Every variable and constant has a specific type
  - Expressions that evaluate to value have a type
- What exactly is a type?
  - A type specifies up to four main characteristics of data that can be storage
    - The storage space that a variable of the type requires
    - The maximum and minimum values that it can represent
    - The members (methods, fields, events, and so on...) that it contains
    - The base type it inherits from
- What does 'type-safe' means?
  - The compiler makes sure that all operations performed are valid for the type of data being manipulated
- C# provides a standard set of built-in types
  - Numeric
  - String
  - Object
- Types are divided into two categories
  - VALUE TYPES
  - REFERENCE TYPES

### Value and reference type

- The .NET Framework stores item in memory in one of two locations
  - Stack
  - Heap
- Value types are stored on the Stack
- Reference types are stored on the Heap

- Let's look at value types stored on the Stack...
  - Each variable is stored on the stack in the order it was created
  - Each variable stores its own data
  - The amount of memory required to store a value type is a set amount
  - When the variable is no longer needed, it is deleted from the stack
- Now, let's look at reference values...
  - The variable is stored on the stack
  - The data is stored on the heap

### Collection and Arrays

There are two ways to create and manage groups of related objects in C#

- Creating an array of objects
- Creating a collection of objects

- Arrays store multiple variables of the same type in an array data structure
- Collections provide a flexible way to work with groups of objects
  - Unlike arrays, the group of objects can grow and shrink dynamically
  - There are a number of different kinds of collections


    using System;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    
    namespace Collection_and_Arrays
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                // Create a collection that is a list of strings
                var dogs = new List<string>();
    
                dogs.Add("Bulldog");
                dogs.Add("Collie");
                dogs.Add("Retriever");
    
                // foreach to move through the list
                foreach(var dog in dogs)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(dog + " ");
                }
    
                Console.WriteLine(dogs[1]);
    
                // Create a array of integers
                int[] a1 = new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 };
    
                foreach(int i in a1)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(i + " ");
                }
            }
        }
    }

## Exception Handling

- In C#, unexpected or exceptional situations are called 'exceptions'
  - When an exception occurs, it 'bubbles up' through the call stack looking for code that catches and handles the
    exception
- C# provides the Try, Catch, Finally block to handle exceptions
  - It should be used around statements that might cause an exception
- Exceptions are represented by classes
  - These classes are derived from Exception
  - This class identifies the type of exception and contains properties that have details about exception
    Syntax

1. TRY (All code in the TRY block is executed)
2. CATCH (if an exception occurs, the code in the CATCH block is executed)
3. FINALLY [optional] (This code is always executed)
   Exception can be raised in code using "throw"


    using System;
    
    namespace Exception_Example
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                int a = 4;
                int b = 0;
    
                try
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("a divided by b is: " + a / b);
                }
                catch(Exception e)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("The following error has occured: " + e.Message);
                }
                finally
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Finally has been called...");
                }
    
                Console.WriteLine("... the program continues...");
            }
        }
    }

## String Builder

- In C# a string is an object of type String whose value is text
  - Internally, the text is stored as a sequential readonly collection of Char objects
- The string keyword is an alias for String
- String objects are immutable
  - They cannot be changed after they have been created
  - All methods and operation that appear to modify a string actually create a new string
- String operations in .NET are highly optimised
  - Under most conditions their use will not impact performance
  - Looping functions that execute hundreds or thousands of times performing string operations can affect performance
- The StringBuilder class creates a string buffer that provides better performance in these situations 


    using System;
    using System.Text;
    
    namespace String_Builder
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                string s1 = "This is an example of ";
                s1 = s1 + "string concatenation";
                Console.WriteLine(s1);
    
                StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder("This is an example of ");
                sb2.Append("string concatenation");
                Console.WriteLine(sb2);
    
                sb2.AppendLine();
                sb2.Append(" using StringBuilder...");
                Console.WriteLine(sb2);
    
                sb2.Replace("StringBuilder", "the StringBuilder class");
                Console.WriteLine(sb2); 
            }
        }
    }

## StringWriter and StringReader

- These classes provide the ability to manipulate string data inside a StringBuilder object
  - StringWriter writes to the StringBuilder object
  - StringReader read string data from the StringBuilder object
  - Use them when you are dealing with lot of string manipulation


    using System;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Text;
    
    namespace StringWriter_And_StringReader
    {
        class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                StringReadWrite srw = new StringReadWrite();
            }
        }
    
        #region "Write data using StringWriter"
        public class StringReadWrite
        {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    
            public StringReadWrite()
            {
                WriteData();
                ReadData();
            }
    
            public void WriteData()
            {
                StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(sb);
    
                Console.WriteLine("Please enter you first and last name...");
                string name = Console.ReadLine();
    
                sw.WriteLine("Name: " + name);
                sw.Flush();
                sw.Close();
            }
            #endregion
            #region "Read data from the StringBuilder object"
            public void ReadData()
            {
                StringReader sr = new StringReader(sb.ToString());
    
                Console.WriteLine("Reading the information...");
    
                while(sr.Peek() > -1)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(sr.ReadLine());
                }
    
                Console.WriteLine();
                Console.WriteLine("Thank you!");
    
                sr.Close();
            }
            #endregion
        }
    }

# Working with C# types

## Properties and fields

- Properties and fields provides objects the ability to store data
  - Consider a Person object
  - Gender
  - Weight
  - Age
- The are ofter called '_properties_' 
- How should we provide the ability to set and change this data? 
  - Uncontrolled access to data can create serious issues
  - Invalid values can cause errors
  - Invalid values can create security concerns
- Encapsulation solves the problem
  - And explains the difference between properties nad fields
  - This principle states that data stored inside an object
  - Not directly publicly accessible from outside the object
- Fields provide the ability to store data privately
- Properties provide the ability to access and change data privately
  - A field is only available from within the object
- Properties provide the ability to read and write data to the private fields
  - Specifically, they provide encapsulation for the fields
  - Data being written to or read from a field can be verified, modified, ect.
- Properties look and feel like public data members
  - The are actually special methods called accessors
  - Here's the short version...
    - A fields is a private variable that can only be accessed by code withing the object
    - A property is used to provide public access to the private field
  

    class Program
    {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
        Person p = new Person();
        p.Age = 91;
        p.Weight = 75;
      
        Console.WriteLine("Age: " + p.Age);
      }
    }
  
    public class Person
    {
      public string Firstname { get; set; }
      public int Weight { get; set; }
  
      private int age;

      public int Age
      {
        get
        {
          return age;
        }
        set
        {
          if ((value > 0) && (value < 65))
          {
              age = value;
          }
          else
          {
              throw new Exception("Age cannot be over 65...");
          }
        }
      }
    }

## Methods

- A method is a named code block that carries out a series of statements
  - A program causes the statements to be executed by calling the method and specifying any required method arguments
  - Similar to subroutines in other languages
  - In C#, every executed instruction is performed in the context of method
- Method have a few characteristics you should understand
  - Access modifier
    - Controls the availability of the method to other code
    - See 'ACCESS MODIFIERS'
  - Return type
    - Method can return a value to the calling code
    - Sometimes called a function when it's return a value
    - If the return type is not '_void_' the method will return a value
    - A '_return_' statement inside the method will stop execution and return a value to the caller if the value matches the return type
    - If the value matches the return type
  - Parameters
    - Specifies the name and data type of values that must be provided when the method is called
    - The values passed to the methods parameters are called arguments
    - The arguments must be compatible with the parameter data type
  - Signature
    - Refers to the structure of the method
    - For overloading, the signature includes the method name and the parameter types
    - For delegates, the signature includes the return type and the parameter types
  - Access modifiers
    - All type and members have an accessibility level
      - Controls wheaten they can be used from other code within and assembly or other assembly
    - Five accessibility levels
      - Public
        - The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it
      - Private
        - The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct
      - Protected
        - The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct, or in a class that is derived from that class
      - Internal
        - The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly
      - Protected internal
        - The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared...
        - Or from within a derived class in another assembly

### Named and optional arguments

- NOTE: The words '_parameters_' and '_arguments_' are often used interchangeably
- A method's parameters are usually utilized positionally


    public int NewInfo(string fname, int age) 
    {
      // ...
    }

    NewInfo("John", 25);

- Named argument can be used instead if positional


    NewInfo(age: 25, fname: "John");

- By default, all parameters listed are required when calling the method
- Optional parameters can be defined
  - Each optional parameter has a default value as part of it's definition
  - If no argument is send for that parameter, the default value is used
- Optional parameters are defined at the end of the parameter list, after any required parameters


    public int NewInfo(string fname, int age, string lname = "Smith") 
    {
      // ...
    }

    NewInfo("John", 25);


### Understanding constructors

- Every class or struct has a constructor
- What is a constructor? 
  - A method that executes automatically every time an object is instantiated from the class
  - A method with same name as the class
  - If a constructor is not provided by the programmer, C# creates a default contructor
- What does a constructor do?
  - Enables actions to be taken as an object is created based on the class
  - Set default values
  - Limit instantiation
  - Take a specific action
  - Ect.
- There are three main types of constructors
  - INSTANCE
    - Used to create and initialize any instance member variables when you use the new expression to create an object of a class
  - PRIVATE
    - Prevents other classes from creating instances of this class.
    - Only nested classes can create an instance of this class
  - STATIC
    - Used to initialize any static data
    - A static constructor is called only once before the first instance of the class is created or any static members are referenced
  - CONSTRUCTORS CAN BE OVERLOADED


    class Program
    {
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
        DefContructor dc = new DefContructor();
        dc.DoThis();

        AddConstrutor ac = new AddConstructor();
      }
    }
  
    public class DefContructor
    {
      public void DoThis()
      {
        Console.WriteLine("Do this...");
      }
    }

    public class AddConstructor
    {
      public AddConstructor()
      {
        Console.WriteLine("Add constructor...");
        DoThat();
      }

      public void DoThat() 
      {
        Console.WriteLine("Do that...");
      }
    }
    
    // Output
    // Do this...
    // Add constructor...
    // Do that...
