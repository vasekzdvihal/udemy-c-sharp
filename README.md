# Learning Practice Repository
This is a collection of practice projects and exercises I worked on while following free online courses, tutorials, and other resources. The content here serves as personal notes and practice â€” not a presentation of the original courses.

The repository focuses on C# and .NET development, including ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and other related technologies.
